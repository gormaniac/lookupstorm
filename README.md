**This project is now maintained as part of the [StormLib++](https://github.com/gormaniac/stormlibpp/) project! It is available [here](https://github.com/gormaniac/stormlibpp/tree/main/src/pkgs/lookup-storm).**

A Synapse Rapid Power-Up for looking up common atomic indicators in Synapse as strings rather than a `<form>=<valu>` pair.

Not every Synapse user can, or should be expected to, know the necessary form names for common atomic indicators that analysts use. They need a way to query for these values quickly and without the form.

See the [documentation page](https://gormo.co/lookupstorm) for installation instructions, examples, and more details.
